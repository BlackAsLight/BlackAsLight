# Hey

I'm BlackAsLight, but most people call me Doctor.
 - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some private repositories that are none of your business untill/unless I make them public. The public repositories by me that aren't archived are still actively maintained by me and receive new features etc, when they pop into my head.
 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C/C++, Swift, and Lua. I already know HTML/CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript and some basic levels of Java, although I am not a fan of Java.
 - ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me on discord. My username is Doctor#4293
